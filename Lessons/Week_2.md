### Lesson 2 Blockchain and Cryptocurrency / Blockcain data structure

- Data Structure, is a data organization, integration, management, and storage format that enables efficient Progress ( access and modification ) of data. Binary to more abstract data types.
- Linked List, is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.

- Nodes :
  - Data
  - Link
- Head : First Node

- Somebasic operations on linked list
  - Insertion : add a node (new element) to the list
    - Insert at the beginning
    - Insert at the end
    - Insert after/before a specific element (node)
  - Deletion : Deletes an element from the list
    - Delete from the beginning
    - Delete from the end
    - Delete a specific element (node)
  - Traversal : Access each element of the linked list
  - Searching : Search an element in the linked list using a given key
  - Sort : Arrange elements Ascending or Descending order according to a given key

- Type of linked list :
- Singly linked list : Each node has only one link to the next node
- Doubly linked list : Each node has two links, one to the previous node and one to the next node
- Circular linked list : The last node of the list points to the first node (or the head) of the list
