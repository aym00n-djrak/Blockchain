## Blockchain applications in healthcare

- Lack of Interoperability
- Inaccessible medical records
- Lack of comprehensive and secure health data
- Data security
- Privacy concerns

Current stautus : Paper records 15% to 20 % not well organized because paper OLD + lack of accessibility
Existing digital systems are dated

Solutions :  Immutable recordkeeping

- Data cannot be altered
- Ensures trustworthiness of records

## Healthcare challenges

## State of patients records

## blockchain solutions

## Data sharing & Interoperability

Scattered data leads to misdiagnoses and repeated tests
vulnerability to breaches and unauthorized access
varied formats hinder data sharing.
Delays can be critical in emergencies.

## Blockchain and data sharing

smartcontracts encrypted

## data security and identity management

old : centralized databases are vulnerable | identity tefth risks

## Blockchain's role in enhancing security

decentralization (no single point of failure)

immutable records (data integrity)

cryptography (advanced data encryption)

smartcontracts ... (automated authenticity verification)

supply chain transparency

## Logistics and trust
