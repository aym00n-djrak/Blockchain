### Blockchain 28/08/23

- One of the first know digital disruption that laid the foundation of the Internet was TCP/IP (in the 1970s)

- Before TCP/IP, it was the era of circuit switching,which required dedicated connection between two parties for communication to happen. (before telepone)

### Build atop the open and decentralized TCP/IP

- 1970: INTERNET
- 1990: WEB (HTTP)
- 1995: WEB 1.0 (Internet Explorer)
- 2005: WEB 2.0 (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube)
- 2015: WEB 3.0 (Blockchain)

### WEB 1.0 ( Static Web)

- One way communication website that thee reader can read but not interact with it.

- Read only web, presenter and reader, static social web. (Centralized)

### WEB 2.0 (Dynamic Web)

- Two way communication website that the reader can read and interact with it.

- Presenter and reader, participative social web. (Centralized)

### WEB 3.0 (Semantic Web)

- Executable web.
- Read, write and execute.
- AI, semantic web, machine learning, big data, 3D printing, IoT, VR, AR, MR, etc. (Decentralized)

### Internet of WHAT ?

- PAST  Internet of Information
- FUTURE  Internet of Value

## Internet of Value

We transfer value from one node to another node.
We transfer ownership of value from one node to another node. Without informing any third party.

Important things : TRUST (The bank and more)

Transacting directly with someone who i sphysically not present close by is difficult.

- A bank was always needed to impose TRUST and secure SECURITY for transactions between two or more parties.

### QUESTION ?

What if technology could enable TRUST and SECURITY without these INTERMEDIARY and CENTRALIZED systems?

### Blockchain

Functionality of Blockchain from Two perspectives:

- Business Perspective (What and How)
  - What is the function of Blockchain?
  - How it works in application?

- Technical Perspective (What and How)
  - What are the technical details of blockchain?
  - How is it technically implemented?

### Business Overview (WHAT)

- Blockchain database. (Schema)

Blockchain is a system of records to transact value (not just money) in a peer-to-peer fashion.

No middle-man, no bank or any other intermediary is required to transact value.

- There is no need for a trusted third party to transact value.

- Example : Transaction through an intermediary vs, peer-to-peer transaction.

If Alice pays to Bob $10, why would it go through a bank?

 Yes because their is a third party that is trusted by both parties.

 With Blockchain, Alice can pay Bob directly without any third party. But their is a problem, how can we trust Alice?

 All the nodes in the network will verify the transaction and if it is valid, it will be added to the blockchain.

 ### Technical Overview (WHAT)

 - Blockchain is a peer-to-peer system of transacting values.
 - it is a shared, decentralized , and open ledger of transactions. This ledger database is replicated across a large number of nodes.
 - This ledger database is an append-only database and cannot be changed or altered. It means that every entry is a permanent entry.
 - Any new entry on it gets reflected on all copies of the databases hosted on different nodes.
 - There is no need for trusted third parties to serve as intermediaries to verify, secure, and settle the transactions.
 - It is another layer on top of the Internet and can coexist with other Internet technologies.

### The blockchain data structure

- Blockchain is a chain of blocks.

Block-1 : Genesis Block <- (Previous block | Transactions) <- (Previous block | Transactions)

- Every node on the blockchain network has an identical copy of the blockchain.
- Every block is a collection of transactions.
- two major parts in every block: Header and Body.
  - The "Header" links back to the previous block in the chain.
  - The "body content" has a validated list of transactions. Their amount, the addresses of the parties involvedn and some more details.

### Summary

- Transaction data in the blocks is immutable
- All transactions are fully irreversible
- Any change would result in a new transaction, which would get validated by all contributing nodes.
- Every node has its own copy of the blockchain.

### Centralized | Decentralized | Distributed

- A centralized system has a centralized control with all administrative authority.

- A decentralized system does not have a centralized control and every node has equal authority.

Centralization or decentralization of a system is not only limited to the technical architecture.

Distributed system is centralized or decentralized, it can still be distributed.

### What is distributed ? The processing power

- Centralized distributed system : There is a master node responsible ofr breaking down the tasks or data and distribute the load across nodes.

- Decentralized distributed system : there is no "master" node as such and yet the computation may be distributed.

### Different Perspectives in Decentralization

- Technical Architecture
  - How many physical computers (or nodes) are used to design a system ?
  - How many node failures it can sustain before the whole system goes down ?
- Political Perespective
  - The control that and individual, or a group of people, or an organization as a whole has on a system.
- Logical Perspective
  - How it appears to be, irrespective of whether it is centralized or decentralized technically or politically.
  - If vertically but the systel and they can operate as indepedent units, it is a decentralized system logically.

### Examples

The language of communication :

- Technical architecture : decentralized
- Political Perspective : decentralized
- Logical Perspective : decentralized

The Content Delivery Network (CDN) :

- Technical architecture : decentralized
- Political Perspective : centralized
- Logical Perspective : decentralized

### Centralized systems

They have a centralized control with all administrative authority.

- They are easy to design, maintain, impose trust, and gouvern. But suffer from many inherent limitations.
- They habe a central point of failure, so are less stable.
- They are more vulnerable to attack and hence less secured.
- Centralization of power can lead to unethical operations.

### Decentralized systems

A decentralized system does not have a centralized control and every node has equal authority.

- These systems are difficult to design, maintain, impose trust.

They do not have a central point of failure, so more stable and fault tolerant.

Attack resistant, as no central point to easily attack and hence more secured.

Symmetric system, so more democratic and fair.

### Lets summarize

Decentralization is almost no ALL or NOTHING !

Almost no system is purely decentralized (or purely centralized).

Example: Email [Decentralized protocol, but dominated by centralized service providers]


### IDEALLY : Decentralized and P2P BLOCKCHAIN

Unlike common distributed systems, the task is not subdivided and delegated to nodes.

There is no master node who would do that in blockchain.

The contributing nodes do not work on a portion of the work.


The objective of Blockchain was to enable decentralization : 

- Technical architecture : decentralized
- Political Perspective : decentralized
- Logical Perspective : centralized


### Peer to peer network :

open to anyone, low barrier to entery


### Mining: 

 It is also open to anyone, and should be technically decentralized, but because it requires a very high capital cost, there is an inevitable concentration of power.

 Update to software:

 Core developers trusted by community, have great power.

 ### Advantages

 - Elimiation of intermediaries
 - Easier and genuine verification of transactions
 - Increased security with lower cost
 - Greater transparency
 - Decentralized and immutable
