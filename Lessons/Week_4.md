## Blockchain and cryptocurrency

Applied previous things to blockchain.

### P2P Network

- All computers in the network hold an identical copy of the ledger of transactions, which acts as a single point of reference.
- Storing data across a P2P network eliminates problems arising from the vulnerability of centralized servers while using different cryptographic methods to secure the network.
- Blochain provides a universal state layer
- This new form of distributed data storage and management also avoids the double spending problem of existing value of transfer over the Internet.

### Distributed ledger

A copy of the ledger is stored on multiple devices off a cryptographically secured P2P network.

- In fact, this ledger is the blockchain.
- It maintains a continuously growing list of transaction data records chained in blocks that are cryptographically secured from tampering and revision.
- In order to change the contents of that ledger, network users need to reach a mutual agreement, also referred ato as consensus.

### Blockchain

- BLockchain builds on the idea of P2P networks.
- It provides a universal data set that every actor can trust, even though they might not know or trust each other.

- it provides a shared and trusted ledger of transactions, where immutable and encrypted copies of information are stored on every node in the network.
- Economic incentives in the form of native network tokens are applied to make the network fault tolerant, and attack and collision resistant.


- Blockchain nedds a consensus mechanism that enables distributed control over the ledger.
- A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values.


### Cryptographic hash function

- A cryptographic hash function is a one-way function that converts input data of arbitraty length and produces a fixed-length output.
- The output is usually termed 'hash-value'
- We can have collisions, same output of hash function for 2 differents inputs.
